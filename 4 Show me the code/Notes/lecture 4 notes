<!-- if we have to write css in jsx then we have to write it in object, i.e:
 let styleCard={
    color: red,
 } -->
 <!-- const Card =()=>{
     return (
         <div style={styleCard}>hello there!</div> OR
        <div style ={{color:red}}>
    ) -->
 <!-- } this will make text color red. -->



 <!-- Making our cards dynamic by using props:
 // Props are just normal function arguments: passing a prop to a component means passing a argument to a function.
 // React will wrap all the props as an object and passing over props parameter.
// To pass some dynamic data to component we can pass it as a props.  -->
