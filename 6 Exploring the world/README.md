MONOLITH ARCHITECTURE:
when the apps were developed traditionally they were all developed using a Monolith Architecture. What does it mean, so earlier we have a huge big project and suppose if we are building an application in this huge project we used to have small pieces we have developed API's inside this project we also have UI code inside the same project we have Authentication code inside it and also database. Now suppose if we have to change minor thing like color of a button what we used to do is we have to build this whole project we have to compile this whole project and we have to deploye this whole project so that is Monolith Architecture.
