MONOLITH ARCHITECTURE:
when the apps were developed traditionally they were all developed using a Monolith Architecture. What does it mean, so earlier we have a huge big project and suppose if we are building an application in this huge project we used to have small pieces we have developed API's inside this project we also have UI code inside the same project we have Authentication code inside it and also database. Now suppose if we have to change minor thing like color of a button what we used to do is we have to build this whole project we have to compile this whole project and we have to deploye this whole project so that is Monolith Architecture.

MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE:
Now a days the world is kind of moving towards Microservice Architecture all the big companies are preffering to make microservices. In this we have different services for all different jobs for example we have a service which is backend services we have a UI service, we have service which connects to Database, we have a service for our SMS sending these are known as Microservices and all these services combined together forms a big app means for every thing we have a different project and this is known as SEPARATION OF CONCERNS and SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE where each and every service has its own job.
So in Monolith Architecture all the developers the backend developers, frontend developers everybody used to work in the same project everybody used to work in same github repository now with Microservice Architecture all of the teams work on their own independent services.

useEffect Hook:
if we want to run or do something after the working of render function then we have to use useEffect hook.
